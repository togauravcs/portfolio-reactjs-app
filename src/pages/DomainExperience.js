2. Dassault Systèmes – Healthcare Domain

At Dassault, I contributed to a healthcare research platform designed to simulate and track drug testing workflows, similar to what is used in pharmaceutical laboratories.
The system supported various user roles like research officers, lab technicians, data analysts, and regulatory personnel. Each role interacted with different drug types and test phases (e.g., Preclinical, Phase I/II/III clinical trials).

Key highlights:
	•	Tested modules for tracking drug test results, user access levels, and regulatory compliance
	•	Validated dashboards and KPIs related to drug efficacy, patient safety, and trial performance

3. Tech Mahindra – Transportation Domain (Railroads – USA)

In this role, I was part of a team working on systems for U.S. railroad transportation.
We worked with clients focused on improving logistics, train scheduling, cargo tracking, and safety monitoring.
The platform integrated data from rail sensors, GPS systems, and control rooms to optimize railroad operations.

Main responsibilities:
	•	Testing end-to-end freight tracking and routing systems
	•	Validating data from IoT devices like axle counters and signal systems
	•	Ensuring compliance with U.S. transportation regulations and safety standards

4. NICE Systems – Finance Domain (Anti-Money Laundering - AML)

At NICE, I worked on an AML (Anti-Money Laundering) solution for banking clients, where the goal was to detect and prevent suspicious financial activities.

Responsibilities included:
	•	Validating alert generation for high-risk transactions, unusual account behavior, and regulatory triggers
	•	Testing rules and scenarios based on AML typologies (e.g., structuring, layering, smurfing)
	•	Working closely with teams to fine-tune threshold settings and alert disposition workflows
